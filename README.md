# Hi, I'm Amir

I am a computer engineering student with a strong interest in artificial intelligence, data science, and algorithmic trading. 
My focus is on building practical, system-oriented projects that combine programming, data analysis, and quantitative thinking.

I have an intermediate background in programming and trading, and I am currently strengthening my foundations in data science and AI with hands-on projects and structured daily practice.

## Technical Skills
- **Languages:** Python, C, C++, SQL  
- **Data Science & AI:** NumPy, Pandas, data visualization, machine learning fundamentals  
- **Trading & Quant:** trade journaling, performance analysis, risk metrics, crypto market analysis  
- **Tools:** Git, PyCharm, VS Code, Excel  
- **Foundations:** algorithms, data structures, systems programming

## Featured Projects
### Crypto Trading Journal (Excel + Python)
A customized trade journaling system designed for crypto trading.  
Includes structured logging, performance metrics, risk analysis, and post-trade evaluation.

### Data Science & AI Learning Projects
A growing collection of Python-based experiments covering:
- data cleaning and analysis
- exploratory data analysis
- basic machine learning models
- applied problem-solving

### C / C++ Programming Practice
Low-level programming exercises focused on memory management, pointers, control flow, and core systems concepts.

## Current Focus
- Building strong fundamentals in data science and AI  
- Developing disciplined, data-driven trading workflows  
- Studying algorithms, systems thinking, and human psychology  
- Preparing for a focused learning and trading year before university

## Learning Philosophy
I prioritize understanding fundamentals, writing clean code, and building systems that can be analyzed, improved, and scaled over time.
